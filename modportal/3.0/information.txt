
# Features

Adds a Screenshot Camera accessible via shortcut (right of quickbar) and hotkey (default: Printscreen). Holding the camera in the cursor will open the screenshot menu. You can then adjust settings, use the camera-cursor to select a limited area or just take a full-screen picture right away. If you selected an area you can also drag, rotate and resize it afterwards.


# Demo

You can see the camera draging rotating and resizing here:
